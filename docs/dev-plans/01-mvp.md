# Stage 1. MVP

## Development stack

At first I thought Node.js with Express.js is a good option (and I still think it's not bad) but I decided to use Kotlin as Kotlin can give **fun** and **joy**.

As it will be Kotlin, there will be some Java/Kotlin frameworks for web. I want to use reactive ones just because.

_Look at [this beautiful site](https://www.kotlinresources.com/) with Kotlin libraries._

Kotlin candidates for now:
- https://www.kotlinresources.com/library/ktor/
- https://www.kotlinresources.com/library/vertx-lang-kotlin/
- https://www.kotlinresources.com/library/hexagon/
- https://www.kotlinresources.com/library/kara/
- http://sparkjava.com/

_Btw, I liked Play Framework very much recently, but it is written in Scala, so I'm afraid it can't be used here._

It's the description of MVP, so it's possible to try several options for now.

## Basics

I see it all as the SPA using server API's, so the front-end framework also needs to be chosen, but I feel like it's far less important during the MVP stage.

I'll try to experiment with React.js firstly.

For the MVP stage there should be several API endpoints (which maybe can be accessed via Swagger)

**TODO.** Use Swagger to get SWAG

## Auth

I don't know a lot about SPA and I think I should do a research about authentication in those apps. It's interesting, can I use plain old cookies for that?

Suggestion about using [JWT](https://auth0.com/docs/security/store-tokens)

## `fs` module

Create a directory for every user and store all files in that directory.

It should support the following functions:

- `listDirectory(path: String)`
- `createDirectory(path: String)`
- `downloadFile(path: String): ByteStream`
- `uploadFile(path: String, stream: ByteStream)`
- `delete(path: String, recursive: Boolean, force: Boolean)`

**TODO.** Add more functions, but they can wait until the next stage. For example `move` and `copy`.

`fs` is just a module that allows user to store files in a separate directory directly on the disk. So `fs` module provides basic functions as every fs does.

Check note about metadata on [ideas page](./ideas.md). Meta is useful and that's what I definitely want to have in rwlist, but it shouldn't be implemented at this stage.

Basically, fs should be used only for blobs.

## `db` module

`db` is very similar to `fs`, but stores BSON documents in MongoDB.

It also allows advanced structures like virtual directories, read more on [ideas page.](./ideas.md)

Add/delete directory, add/delete/edit document should be enough for the MVP.

## Development organization

GitHub has projects, I definitely should give them a try.

Markdown files are good for now, aren't they?
